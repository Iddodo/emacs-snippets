#+title: My (Interesting?) Emacs Snippets

This is where I'll put some Emacs snippets that I've made that are interesting
enough to want to share with other people, but do not belong elsewhere.

I might develop some of these snippets further someday.

** Use AirDrop-CLI to AirDrop files from within Emacs
This is a game changer as far as I'm concerned,
and it's helping me tremendously during my exams.

It even automatically picks up your currently opened file!

This uses the awesome CLI tool for AirDrop, which can be found [[https://github.com/vldmrkl/airdrop-cli][here]].

(defun airdrop-cli-prompt-run ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((buffer-fname (buffer-file-name))
         (buffer-fname-stripped (file-name-nondirectory buffer-fname))
         (buffer-dir (file-name-directory buffer-fname))
         (target-fname
          (read-file-name (concat  "File (default: '" buffer-fname-stripped "')") buffer-dir buffer-fname-stripped)))

    (unless (file-exists-p target-fname)
      (error "File does not exist."))
    (call-process-shell-command  (concat "airdrop " target-fname))))

* School related
Snippets intended to make my university life generally easier.

** org-school-insert-folder-pdf-exam-checkboxes-under-subheading
[[./media/checkboxes.gif]]
  Under some heading for a course, prompt user for a directory
   in which they store its exams. Then create a subheading called \"EXAMS\",
   under which all relevant exam PDF files will appear in the form of
   checkboxes.
   The idea was that I would use this to organize the methodology of
   solving exams.

   This function is obviously very tailored to my use case, and currently
   it does not offer any customization, and is not as clever as I would
   like it to be, but it definitely does the trick.

   I might make an effort to generalize the way it works in the future,
   and might even expand the idea to generate more useful workflows.
